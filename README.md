# Hey, I'm Hayden ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! If itâ€™s weird and technical, Iâ€™m interested. Occasionally, I turn bugs into features. But donâ€™t tell anyone..

## ðŸŽ® What I Love
- Building game engines and production renderers (C++ is my jam)
- R&D is half the fun.. and by half I mean all of it
- Making things work that probably shouldnâ€™t

## ðŸ§ª Current Obsessions
- Graphics tricks and awesome engine internals
- Turning wild ideas into (questionably) working prototypes
- Trying to figure out why that one bug only happens at 2am
