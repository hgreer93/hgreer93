# Hey, I'm Hayden ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! If itâ€™s weird and technical, Iâ€™m interested. Occasionally, I turn bugs into features, but donâ€™t tell anyone..

## What I Love
- Building game engines and photorealistic renderers. It's fascinating!
- R&D is half the fun.. and by half, I mean all of it :)
- Also making things work that probably shouldnâ€™t..
  .. I seem to be good at that..
